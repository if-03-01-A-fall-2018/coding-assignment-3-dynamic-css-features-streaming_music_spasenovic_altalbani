    <h1>Gramophone Records</h1>
    <p>In October 1896, inventor and entrepreneur Emil Berliner abandoned the use of hard rubber as a plate material and replaced the substance with a molding compound
    produced by Duranoid Co., Newark, New Jersey, which consisted essentially of shellac as a binder and was originally developed for insulators had been.
    The shellac bound the other ingredients, the fillers barium sulfate, slate flour, soot and cotton flock, to a wear-resistant mass.
    The innovation improved the sound quality and durability of the plates enormously, but a disadvantage was the high brittleness and thus the risk of breakage.</p>

    <p>However, as long as one wanted records that could be reproduced purely mechanically via a sound box, ie without electrical amplification, there was no viable alternative.
    In the US, several factors came together in the 1940s, suggesting a change from shellac material to PVC (vinyl): on the one hand turntables had prevailed with electric pickup, on the other hand shellac had to be imported.</p>

    <p>Since vinyl records destined for children are a key selling point, they are virtually unbreakable, so in 1944 they began to press them in PVC, but still with a wide groove and 78 turns.</p>

    <p>Vinyl records, where the other advantages of the material, that it allows lower playback speeds and thus a longer playing time, were exhausted, there was until 1948 only in the broadcasting as well as test and Demopressungen.
    Only then were vinyl records with micro grooves and suitable playback devices for use at home brought out.</p>

    <p>Shellac plates were produced in the Federal Republic of Germany until 1958, in other European countries until the early and in the so-called Third World until the late 1960s.</p>
    The last plates are said to have been pressed in 1972 in South Africa. Until the early 1980s, almost all turntables were equipped with the speed setting of 78 min-1,
    could easily be provided with needles for shellac records and were thus suitable for this plate format.</p>


    <h1></h1>
    <p>As early as 1880, the American physicist Charles Sumner Tainter (Columbia Graphophone Company) discovered that many of the technical disadvantages of Edisonian rollers (cumbersome handling and costly duplication) could be eliminated by spiraling the soundtrack into the surface of a flat, engraved round disc. Tainter developed the prototype of a corresponding recording apparatus and produced some recorded wax plates, but gave up the experiments due to technical problems after a short time again. Tainter's wax plates are now in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. They are considered the first records in the world.</p>
