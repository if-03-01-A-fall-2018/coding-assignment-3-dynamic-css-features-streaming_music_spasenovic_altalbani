     <p>The history of iTunes begins in 2001 and continues to the present. </p>

       <p>The current version of iTunes enables users to manage media content, create playlists, synchronize media content with handheld devices including the iPod, iPhone and iPad, re-image and update handheld devices, stream Internet radio and purchase music, films, television shows, audiobooks and applications via the iTunes Store.  </p>
    <h1>Information</h1>
      <p> iTunes lacked support for 64-bit versions of Windows until the 7.6 update on January 16, 2008.  </p>
    <p>   iTunes is currently supported under any 64-bit version of Windows, although the iTunes executable was still 32-bit until version 12.1. </p>
      <p> The 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not supported by Apple, but a workaround has been devised for both operating systems. </p>
      <p> Version 8.0 added Genius playlists, grid view, and a new default visualizer. </p>
